## Abstract
This project presents a machine learning-based approach for predicting the likelihood of heart disease in patients. Utilizing a dataset of patient characteristics, medical history, and lifestyle factors, we train and evaluate multiple machine learning models to identify the most accurate predictor of heart disease. Our results demonstrate the potential of machine learning algorithms in providing early warnings for heart disease, enabling timely interventions and improved patient outcomes.
